## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

1. Why is RwLock preferred over Mutex for a Vec of Notifications? — RwLock is favored because it allows multiple threads to read notifications concurrently while ensuring exclusive access during writes. 
This setup is optimal for scenarios with frequent reads and fewer writes. While Mutex could also serve, it might not handle high-read scenarios as efficiently since it locks out all other accesses, 
including reads, during writes.

2. Why does Rust restrict mutating static variables via static functions? — Rust prioritizes thread safety, and permitting mutable static variables could lead to data races, a significant concern. 
Mutable statics also conflict with Rust's strict ownership and borrowing principles, as they are globally accessible and modifiable from any part of the program. Moreover, static variables are designed 
to be initialized once in a predictable manner, crucial for concurrent environments.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2

1. Exploring beyond the tutorial: I delved into src/lib.rs beyond the tutorial's scope. Essentially, the code prepares our application to communicate with the web using an HTTP client. It handles 
loading settings from default sources and environment variables. Additionally, it manages errors effectively, providing understandable feedback to users.

2. How does the observer pattern facilitate adding more subscribers? — Without the observer pattern, handling duplicates would be cumbersome. This pattern allows us to easily create copies of the 
receiving application, simplifying the process of adding more subscribers.

3. About self-made tests: Indeed, they are beneficial. Generating fake test data proves useful when avoiding hard-coding dummy data. It enables assessing the implementation's correctness and ensures 
that the use case aligns with expectations.
